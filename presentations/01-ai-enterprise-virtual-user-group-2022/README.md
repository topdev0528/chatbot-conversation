### Abstract

AI has become the new cool kid and making the first step with AI projects can be challenging. To help anyone have fun starting AI on open source, we've created the chatbots conversations project.
In this presentation we'll walk through contributing to your first Open Source AI project and share our experience about the journey to build it.

Here is the project we will be working on:
https://github.com/neomatrix369/chatbot-conversations

This project demonstrates a number of concepts:

- NLP (or a simulation of it, using Eliza)
- NLP (or a simulation of it, using Roberta)
- Chatbot interactions (using REST API)
- Microservices frameworks (Helidon and Quarkus)
- And also using a simple `python` Flask app
- Communication between three apps via a central app
- Flexibility to add more chatbots
- Ability to change the models used in place of the existing ones

You can contribute to the session by participating in building the project with us and/or asking questions related to the project. Or reviewing the code and/or open issues on the GitHub repo.

Come online with a system where you can run docker containers; if notâ€”just watch us do this!
